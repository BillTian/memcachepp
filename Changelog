    * Check for negative case in memcache add test.
    * Adding support for the add command in the memcache protocol.
    * Moving basic_request implementation out of memcache.hpp into memcache/request.hpp.
    * Making callback_type and callback_map internal typedefs to basic_request<>.
    * Changes to TODO and README.
    * Making retrieve and perform_action more generic; making validate more efficient.
    * Refactoring implementation of get and get_raw, both now using the retrieve private member function.
    * Cleaning up implementation of set_raw, delete_, get, and get_raw to use refactored functions perform_action and command_setup.
    * Initial refactoring of perform_action to reduce code in public-facing set member function.
    * Code cleanup for eventual refactoring.
    * Small performance enhancing changes; making regex objects function-local static, using STL find_if for some hand-written loops.
    * Adding concept checks to memcache++ implementation; moving handler implementation to its own header file.
    * Qualifying calls to boost::fusion::tie to prevent ambiguous calls to tie error.
    * Adding minimal documentation for the fluent interface.
    * Adding support for CMake as a build system; only for testing.
    * Adding support for a fluent raw_add using operator *=.
    * Adding support for prepending with operator -= in the fluent interface.
    * Adding support for raw appending using operator+= in the fluent interface.
    * Adding support for raw-setting in the fluent interface.
    * Changing the interface for append and prepend, implementing unitary increment and decrement.
    * Fixing test, maybe found potential bug with memcached incr/decr functionality.
    * Refactoring fluent interface test.
    * Supporting value replacement in the fluent interface.
    * Updating clone URL in README.
    * Updating documentation for fluent replacement.
    * Updating documentation regarding interface changes.
    * Updating documentation to highlight raw_add in the fluent interface.
    * Updating documentation to reflect the fluent interface to raw_append with operator+=.
    * Updating documentation to support add semantics using operator /= for keys in the fluent interface.
    * Updating tests to assume locally running memcached is version 1.4.4.

Release 0.10:
    * Documenting fluent interface; added remove function.
    * Making exceptions derive from memcache::exception to ease catching of memcache-specific exceptions; Turning exception types non-templates; Making memcache++ use Spirit.Classic includes.
    * Updating documentation to reflect status of author WRT Friendster, Inc. and supported compilers/platforms.
    * Updating library documentation to reflect additional copyright and new build configuration.
    * Updating INSTALL to reflect changes and requirements.
    * Renaming memcache++ directory to memcachepp.
    * Adding include for vector serialization support.
