Memcache++ - a memcache client library

Requires:
    Boost C++ Library (1.38 or SVN Trunk)

NOTES:

On Hacking Memcache++:

    * When you find a bug, write a unit test to reproduce the bug
      then make sure that any fixes will not cause regressions to
      earlier marked passing tests.
    * Send email to <dmberris@friendster.com> for feature requests

On Testing Memcache++:

    * You need at least 4 running instances of memcached on the
      local machine to run the tests. The provided test-setup.sh
      script assumes you have memcached installed and available
      from the path. To run it, you need administrator privileges
      on the local machine.
    * Invoking 'bjam' in the home directory will require that you
      have properly installed and set up the Boost.Build version 2
      build system on your machine, and the BOOST_ROOT environment
      variable defined to point to the Boost C++ Library
      distribution root directory.

On Installing Memcache++:

    * Memcache++ is header-only, meaning it can be made part of
      the application you're building. This requires though that
      at build-time, the Boost C++ Library 1.35 or a checkout of
      the Boost subversion trunk is accessible.
    * The required libraries are:
        - Boost.Serialization
        - Boost.Asio (and Boost.System)
        - Boost.Regex
        - Boost.Spirit
