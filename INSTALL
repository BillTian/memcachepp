To install, copy memcachepp/ into a directory convenient for
the compiler to locate by default, or into a directory that can
be configured to be searchable by the compiler.

Memcache++ Client is header only and does not require any
special build instructions. It does however require that you have
Boost.Date_time, Boost.Serialization, and Boost.Spirit installed
and available when building programs that use the 
Memcache++ Client.
